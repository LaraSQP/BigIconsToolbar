# A big icons toolbar pack for common built-in functions

This extension is a proof of concept, namely, to determine if it is possible to customize the toolbar icons for built-in functions or, in other words, to change the appearance of toolbars just like themes do other aspects of the GUI.

Unlike themes, though, Microsoft provides no way to do this and only a partial workaround can be achieved via extensions.

This repository holds the simplest extension that achieves this goal. The code is minimal and intended to allow other developers to use it as a template to release their own icon packs.

## How to get the extension

Clone the code, review it, compile it, and run the extension. It should work with `vs2022` and `vs2026` provided the `Visual Studio Extension Development` workload is installed.

Alternatively, download the binaries from the `Releases` tab (or [here](https://github.com/LaraSQP/BigIconsToolbar/releases/download/1.0/BigIconsToolbar.vsix)).

The screenshot shows a toolbar with the default icons above a second toolbar with the big (ugly) icons from this extension. Both call the same built-in functions.

If the `Big Icons Toolbar` does not appear after installing the extension, right-click on the toolbar and select it from the list of toolbars.

There will also be a submenu `Big Icons Toolbar` under the `Extensions` menu. See the note below.

## How to modify the code

1. Put your 16x16 icons in the `Resources` folder.
1. Modify the `.vsct` file accordingly, that is:
	- Create a <b>GUID</b> and a <b>name</b> for each image under using `GuidSymbol` tags.
	- Load the images using `Bitmap` tags.
	- Create a <b>name</b> for each group using <b>IDSymbol</b> tags.
	- Create a <b>name</b> and a <b>value</b> for each command using <b>IDSymbol</b> tags.
1. Create a `Button` for each command and use `CommandPlacements` to group them.
1. Use the dictionary in the `CommandTable.cs` file to associate the <b>value</b> of each command with the `command name` to be executed. The list of all command names in Visual Studio is in the file `vs-commands.txt` (which can be regenerated by calling the method `DumpCommands()` in `CommandTable.cs`).

<b>Note:</b> The extension also creates a submenu under the `Extensions` menu with an entry for each command and you will need to create/modify these too in the `.vsct` file. The reason for this is so that the commands and icons are listed in the `Customize → Add Command` list under the `Extensions` category. If you find a way of removing these (otherwise unnecessary) menu entries, report it.

## Limitations and TODO

The built-in toolbars will disable and gray icons as appropriate. This extension is meant to keep things as simple as possible and this functionality has not been implemented.

Some built-in functions cannot be customized or included in extensions, such as drop-downs (e.g., `Undo` and `Redo` ) and combo boxes (e.g., `Solution Configurations`). If you find a way, report it.

As of the release of this extension, only the (legacy) `VSIX` extension model can call built-in functions. Extensions built with the (new) `VisualStudio.Extensibility` model will only be able to call built-in functions by "mixing in" code from the VSIX Model.
